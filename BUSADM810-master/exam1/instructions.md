Create a module that represents a sales order that has the properties customer, sales tax rate and an array of items.  It should have a function to return the value of the items (sum the item price times quantity) and a function that returns total value (sum of the value of the items plus the sales tax).

You can use the following to test it:

Widget                 10           $2.50

Gidget                  20           $1.00

 

Tax rate: .10

 

Total value = 49.50
